                    <h3>Sookjai means:</h3>
                    <p>Sookjai is a Thai word that literally translates to "Happy Heart". There are 3 main elements in this logo: text, treble clef, and circle. I worked through all of them one by one:</p>
                    <h3>Starting with the treble clef</h3>
                    <img src="../img/treble-sketch.png" />
                    <p>These treble clefs are representative of many more that I sketching and drawing using an iPad pro and Apple pencil. My goal with each rendering was to continually strip down the clef until it's left with it's elegant bare minimum. In these samples, the <strong>4th rendition</strong> struck me as the most minimal, well-balanced, and centered of all of them. It's my winner!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="full-width body-bottom">
                    <h3>Adjustment journey</h3>
                    <img src="../img/sookjai-travel.png" />
                    <p>I started my drawing board with a simple treble clef and circle. The circle represents the <strong>holistic approach</strong> to music and pedagogy of this school. Experimentation with the typography ensued to find something that best suits the brand's character.</p>
                    <p>Soon after, it dawned on to me that though the school uses a holistic approach, it also teaches unconventionally, breaking set norms and expectations. <strong>This means that an enclosing perfect circle, would not do.</strong></p>
                    <p>I finally adjusted the elements, broke the circle and adjusted the weight of the circle. The play with the school name's kerning, leading, tracking illustrates the playful nature of the school. In the final rendition, I adjusted the weight of each element down even further to achieve an even more simplified look.</p>
